# This repository contains my personal portfolio of projects. The projects are organized by language or technology. I have also included a README file for each project that describes the project's purpose, features, and how to use it.

# TO run this project you have to open main.html in your browser and Enjoy!
# If you have any inquires feel free to contact me my contacts are at the bottom of the portfolio.

# I am always working on new projects, so please check back often!
